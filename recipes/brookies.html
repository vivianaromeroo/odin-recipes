        <h1>Brookies (Brownie Cookies)</h1>

        <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/Ljifx_XSih8l1bZtF4ajL5ERhPw=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/238654-brookies-brownie-cookies-ddmfs-4x3-216-b5371aff3c03454aaeb5d586d35ec841.jpg">
        <p>This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.</p>
